4. **Compare different funding stages** to see stage multiplier effects
5. **Experiment with growth vs. burn rate** trade-offs

## üìä Understanding the Results

### Valuation Components:

- **Revenue Multiple**: Base valuation multiplier
- **Growth Multiplier**: Rewards high growth rates
- **Market Multiplier**: Considers market size potential
- **Team Multiplier**: Values experienced teams
- **Stage Multiplier**: Higher for later funding rounds

### Risk Factors:

- **Revenue Risk**: Low revenue indicates early stage
- **Growth Risk**: Slow growth suggests market challenges
- **Burn Rate Risk**: High burn rate indicates cash flow issues
- **Customer Risk**: Few customers mean concentration risk
- **Team Risk**: Inexperienced teams face execution risk

### Confidence Score:

- **80-100%**: Strong metrics, reliable valuation
- **60-79%**: Good metrics, some uncertainty
